## Assignment

The purpose of this test is to check your frontend skills.
The end result should be a simple blog with the following features:

1) Listing all blog posts, with descending order based on creation date
2) Display an "add" button which allow the user to insert a new post
3) Every blog post should have a delete button that will allow the user to remove the post

Bonus points for:

1) Simple search input field so that user can search/filter articles
2) Display an "edit" button on each article that allows changes to the content
3) Limit the initially shown content of articles that exceed 80 characters with a "read more" link
4) Testing React components

Try to make it look as good as you can with just vanilla CSS.

## Setting up the development environment

### Step 1

Make sure you have the node 10.13.0 installed.
If you have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) installed on your machine you can simply run ```nvm use```.

### Step 2

Run ```npm install``` followed by ```npm run dev```

### Step 3

Check App.js as example of how to perform the API calls needed to complete the assignment.
